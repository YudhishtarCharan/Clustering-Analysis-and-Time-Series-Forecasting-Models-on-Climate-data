# Clustering-Analysis-and-Time-Series-Forecasting-Models-on-Climate-data
The goal of this project is to analyze weather data and forecast future temperatures using unsupervised learning and time series models. Initially, exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be performed to understand the dataset. Then, clustering techniques such as K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and DBSCAN will be applied to identify patterns in the data. After that, ARIMA and SARIMAX models will be used for time series forecasting to predict future temperatures. The models will be evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and accuracy to determine the best forecasting method. The project will conclude with a comparison of the clustering results and forecasting model performances. this in 350 cahracterrs for github
